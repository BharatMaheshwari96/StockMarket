App is designed in the following way:
•	Importing the data into app. Equivalently, In-built dataset might be used for analytics. 
•	Applying some descriptive analytics techniques on the dataset and visualize the quick insights. 
•	Applying probabilistic model e.g. discrete or continuous probability models on the dataset and visualize the insight. 
•	Applying Machine learning techniques
•	Visualizing the deep insight in dashboard environment.
